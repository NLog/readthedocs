Welcome to the NLog documentation! Just start with the [tutorial](wiki/Tutorial) to log messages within minutes!

For .NET Core users, check the  [Platform support](platform-support) table, as there is a limited set implemented. Check the column `NetStandard  1.3`. To read more about  NetStandard, see [the docs from Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/standard/library)

ASP.NET Core users should use [NLog.Extensions.Logging](https://github.com/NLog/NLog.Extensions.Logging/blob/master/README.md)

ASP.NET (Core) users, The [NLog.Web](https://github.com/NLog/NLog.Web/blob/master/README.md) package contains additional renderers and targets. 

Are you missing some targets, layout renderers or renderers in NLog? [Check to extend NLog](Extending NLog) or even better, [contribute to NLog](https://github.com/NLog/NLog#contributing)!
