##Use
Targets are used to display, store, or pass log messages to another destination. There are two kinds of target; those that receive and handle the messages, and those that buffer or route the messages to another target. The second group are called 'wrapper' targets.

##Supported Targets
* [AspNetTrace](AspNetTrace-target) - Writes log messages to the ASP.NET trace.
* [AspResponse](AspResponse-target) - Outputs log messages through the ASP Response object.
* [Chainsaw](Chainsaw-target) - Sends log messages to the remote instance of Chainsaw application from log4j.
* [ColoredConsole](ColoredConsole-target) - Writes log messages to the console with customizable coloring.
* [Console](Console-target) - Writes log messages to the console.
* [Database](Database-target) - Writes log messages to the database using an ADO.NET provider.
* [Debug](Debug-target) - Mock target - useful for testing.
* [Debugger](Debugger-target) - Writes log messages to the attached managed debugger.
* [EventLog](EventLog-target) - Writes log message to the Event Log.
* [File](File-target) - Writes log messages to one or more files.
* [FormControl](FormControl-target) - Logs text to Windows.Forms.Control.Text property control of specified Name.
* [LogReceiverService](LogReceiverService-target) - Sends log messages to a NLog Receiver Service (using WCF or Web Services).
* [Mail](Mail-target) - Sends log messages by email using SMTP protocol.
* [Memory](Memory-target) - Writes log messages to an ArrayList in memory for programmatic retrieval.
* [MessageBox](MessageBox-target) - Pops up log messages as message boxes.
* [MethodCall](MethodCall-target) - Calls the specified static method on each log message and passes contextual parameters to it.
* [MSMQ](MSMQ-target) - Writes log message to the specified message queue handled by MSMQ.
* [Network](Network-target) - Sends log messages over the network.
* [NLogViewer](NLogViewer-target) - Sends log messages to the remote instance of NLog Viewer.
* [Null](Null-target) - Discards log messages. Used mainly for debugging and benchmarking.
* [OutputDebugString](OutputDebugString-target) - Outputs log messages through the OutputDebugString() Win32 API.
* [PerfCounter](PerfCounter-target) - Increments specified performance counter on each write.
* [RichTextBox](RichTextBox-target) - Log text a Rich Text Box control in an existing or new form.
* [Trace](Trace-target) - Sends log messages through System.Diagnostics.Trace.
* [WebService](WebService-target) - Calls the specified web service on each log message.

##Wrapper Targets
* [AspNetBufferingWrapper](AspNetBufferingWrapper-target) - Buffers log events for the duration of ASP.NET request and sends them down to the wrapped target at the end of a request.
* [AsyncWrapper](AsyncWrapper-target) - Provides asynchronous, buffered execution of target writes.
* [AutoFlushWrapper](AutoFlushWrapper-target) - Causes a flush after each write on a wrapped target.
* [BufferingWrapper](BufferingWrapper-target) - A target that buffers log events and sends them in batches to the wrapped target. Useful in combination with Mail target.
* [FallbackGroup](FallbackGroup-target) - Provides fallback-on-error.
* [FilteringWrapper](FilteringWrapper-target) - Filters log entries based on a condition.
* [ImpersonatingWrapper](ImpersonatingWrapper-target) - Impersonates another user for the duration of the write.
* [PostFilteringWrapper](PostFilteringWrapper-target) - Filters buffered log entries based on a set of conditions that are evaluated on a group of events.
* [RandomizeGroup](RandomizeGroup-target) - Sends log messages to a randomly selected target.
* [RepeatingWrapper](RepeatingWrapper-target) - Repeats each log event the specified number of times.
* [RetryingWrapper](RetryingWrapper-target) - Retries in case of write error.
* [RoundRobinGroup](RoundRobinGroup-target) - Distributes log events to targets in a round-robin fashion.
* [SplitGroup](SplitGroup-target) - Writes log events to all targets.

##Custom Targets
[RabbitMQ target](https://github.com/haf/NLog.RabbitMQ) ([NuGet](http://nuget.org/packages/NLog.RabbitMQ)) - sends logs over a RabbitMQ message broker. It allows you to combine your logs in real time across multiple platforms and systems.

NLog supports custom target. For more information, see: [How to write a Target](How-to-write-a-Target)
