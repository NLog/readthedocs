##Use
Targets are used to display, store, or pass log messages to another destination. There are two kinds of target; those that receive and handle the messages, and those that buffer or route the messages to another target. The second group are called 'wrapper' targets. 

NLog supports custom target. For more information, see: [How to write a Target](How-to-write-a-Target)
