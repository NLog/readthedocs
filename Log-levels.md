The following are the allowed log levels (in descending order):
* Off
* Fatal
* Error
* Warn
* Info
* Debug
* Trace


LogLevels in NLog are consistent with Log4j/Log4net, so a description of the usage of these different levels is available on [Wikipedia's entry on log4j](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4j).
