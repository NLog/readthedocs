The following are the allowed log levels (in descending order):
* Off
* Fatal
* Error
* Warn
* Info
* Debug
* Trace


Log Levels in NLog are consistent with Log4j/Log4net, so a description of the different levels' usage on [Wikipedia's entry about log4j](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4j) is applicable for NLog Log Levels.
